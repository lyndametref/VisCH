# VisCH: an exercise for myself on GoogleVis in Shiny (R)

I have done this little app getting data from www.bfs.admin.ch on swiss population between 2010 and 2012 and displaying it using GoogleVis. This is a personal exercise and is by no mean a pertinent support for analysis nor warranted to be accurate.

The ShinyApp is visible here: http://lyndametref.shinyapps.io/VisCHApp/
